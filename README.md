## Project Information
* This application concerns the usage of Firebase, an API, and CRUD.
* The idea is that cocktails will be displayed from an API and users can add them to favorites, custom lists, and write reviews on them. 
* Users can sign up, log in, and log out.
* A user page will be generated to have statistics on their favorites ingredients, type of drinks, etc.
* WARNING: Drink names may be offensive in nature.
